# Outbrain Click Prediction
#### Alex Cho, Kenneth Lipke, Parisa Gandomkar Yarandi 

[Outbrain Click Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction) was a data science competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), where participating teams were tasked to predict the likelihood of ads being clicked by users on websites. We decided to participate in the competition as a way to learn more about various widely used machine learning libraries in Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, PySpark) as well as make use of the machine learning concepts and algorithms we were familiar with.

This repo contains the html version of the Jupyter Notebook we compiled to summarize our findings, and the notebook can be viewed [here](https://aybcho.github.io/outbrain-click-prediction/).
